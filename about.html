            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>NexBook</em> is a textbook rental company that allows students to access resources for their classes and tests in the secondary level. There is a wide variety of materials available on this website like AP prep books, SAT/ACT prep books, approved notebooks, notecards, graphing calculators and more for students can refer to for better understanding while enrolled in their core classes, as well as for college readiness. The purpose of the company is to alleviate the costs of books for students, that being said every student has an equal opportunity to succeed and prepare for the future. The books on the website are donated and sold to the company from upperclassmen and alumni who have completed the course. The books will assist students to understand the content in their classes better. Therefore, the students who spent countless hours used the books for the school year will not be able to benefit from the notes, continuing their education after high school, and handing the resources down to the underclassmen that need it. </p>
